                    <h2 class="section-heading text-center">Overview</h2>
                    <p>Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. In 2016, collegiate hackathons alone attracted over 65,000 participants across 200 events. While "hackathons", that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims: </p>

                    <ul class="overviewlist">

                    <li>"sprints" bring together existing communities to advance planned work, </li>
                    <li>"codefests" bring together related communities to encourage interoperability, </li> 
                    <li>"hack-days" and "hack-weeks" teach hacking and making skills to diverse audiences without software backgrounds, like artists and scientists, </li>
                    <li>"edit-a-thons" support intensive co-generation of encyclopedia content, and so on.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p> Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. </p>

                    <p>This <strong>one-day workshop</strong> will bring together:</p>
                     <ul class="overviewlist">
                         <li> researchers interested in the phenomenon, </li>
                         <li> experienced event organizers, and </li>
                         <li> participants interested in running their own events. </li>
                     </ul>
                      <p> The workshop aims to facilitate consolidating existing research, sharing practical experiences, and understanding what benefits different events may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events and/or collaborative systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.</p>

                        <li><strong>Design variations:</strong> What are the different variations in event design? How variations in design impact event success, participant satisfaction, and group processes, such as idea generation, prototyping, team formation, team dynamics, etc., and diversity and inclusion?</li>
                        <li><strong>Short-term and long-term outcomes:</strong> How do event goals vary across contexts and designs? How do we measure success in achieving these goals? How do we support more long-term outcomes, such as building a long-term community by fostering engagement?</li>
                        <li><strong>Practical support for event organizers:</strong> How do we design tools, processes, and workflows that support organizers and community managers, such as instruments to evaluate outcomes and assess community needs?</li>
                        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> What are the possible application areas of hackathons beyond traditional contexts, e.g., learning environments, user-centered design and HCI research, and non-software engineering work in general? What are the success factors and lessons learned in each of these applications?</li>

What collaboration structures support different event designs and outcomes? What opportunities and challenges do these tools introduce? How do we preserve group and work artefacts when we move from virtual to face-to-face spaces and vice versa?</li>
                        <li><strong>Theoretical space of ‘hackathons’:</strong> Building theory around the ecology and etymology of ‘hacking’ to support a more generalized understanding of the opportunities for collaborative work, e.g., what is the boundary space for events to be considered “hackathons”, what are related activities that go by different names (e.g. Codefests, Sprints), how are they connected, and where does the family of events fit within the broader space of HCI research?</li>
